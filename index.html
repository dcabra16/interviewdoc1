                    <td><strong>Selection Rationale</strong></td>
                    <td>Ashton is a colleague in Medical Records who previously worked as an IT technician in a retail setting and later became a project manager before transitioning into healthcare. His career path is unique because he has hands-on IT experience, project management expertise, and now healthcare medical records. I selected Ashton because his experience mirrors how skills transfer across industries and what employers look for during career shifts.

                    <td><strong>Conversation Summary</strong></td>
                    <td>In our conversation, Ashton shared his journey beginning as an IT technician in retail, where he handled troubleshooting, customer service, and rapid problem solving. He explained that the fast-paced nature of retail IT taught him how to stay calm under pressure and communicate technical issues in a simple way, which became one of his strongest professional skills.
<br>
<br>
From there, Ashton moved into a project manager role. He described how this role pushed him to develop leadership skills, coordinate cross-functional teams, and manage deadlines, budgets, and communication across multiple stakeholders. He mentioned that transitioning into project management required him to see “the bigger picture,” not just the technical details. This experience helped him understand how different departments and systems connect, which later helped him in healthcare.
<br>
<br>
When Ashton moved into healthcare and joined Medical Records, he had to adapt again. He said the biggest shift was learning compliance, privacy laws like HIPAA, and understanding how patient data flows through different healthcare systems. Although it was a very different environment, he found that many of the skills he learned from IT and project management — such as documentation, communication, and problem-solving — carried over naturally.
<br>
<br>
Ashton also talked about the challenges of switching industries. He admitted that it took time to adjust, but he emphasized that curiosity and willingness to learn made the transition possible. He encouraged me not to underestimate the value of the experience I already have and reminded me that healthcare IT benefits greatly from people who understand both workflows and technology.
<br>
<br>
Overall, our conversation was motivating and gave me a realistic understanding of what career transitions look like and how skills from different industries can combine to create new opportunities..</td>

                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Key Insights</strong></td>
                    <td>One of Ashton’s biggest insights was that skills are more transferable than people assume. His background in IT gave him technical confidence, project management gave him structure and leadership, and healthcare taught him compliance and workflow management. He helped me understand that I’m building a similar combination of skills through my Medical Records work and my project management coursework.
<br>
He also emphasized the importance of continuous learning. Ashton said that every job shift required him to learn new systems, tools, and expectations — but learning small pieces consistently made the transitions easier.
<br>
                        <br>
Another key takeaway was his point about communicating goals early. Ashton told me that sharing his interests and asking for opportunities is what helped him move between roles. This reinforced the importance of speaking up and letting managers know what direction you want to grow in.
<br>
                        <br>
Finally, he reminded me that moving into IT doesn’t have to be instant. Many people enter gradually — gaining experience, taking on technical tasks, building confidence, and eventually stepping fully into the role when the time is right.</td>
